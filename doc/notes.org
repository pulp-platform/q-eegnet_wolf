* Implementation
** Total number of weights: less than 3kB
** Fusing Layer 1 and 2
Fusing together the first two convolutions (spectral convolution and spatial convolution)
*** Benefits:
- Reducing memory bandwidth by factor 5.6 (17.83%)
- Same result
- Still very good paralellizable on 8 cores, no overlapp
- Everything fits into l1: All Weights, input sample and space for the result of the second convolution! (Everything can be done on 
*** Method:
- On core i: [0, 8)
- For each sample t: [0, 1125), do:
  - compute y1[i, ch, t] forall ch: [0, 22)
  - compute y2[k, t] forall k: 2*i, 2*i+1
*** Memory Requirements
- Storing a time sample as 1152 values (e.g. 0x480) instead of 1125 (e.g. 0x465)
- Input: 24.75kB = 1152 * 22 / 1024
- Output: 18kB = 1152 * 16 / 1024
- Intermediate: 176B = 8 * 22
- Total: 42.92kB < 64kB on L1
*** Bandwidth Improvements:
- Intermediate memory requirements when not fusing: 198kB = 1152 * 22 * 8 / 1024
- Total memory requirements without fusing: 240.75kB = 1152 * (22 + 22 * 8 + 16) / 1024
- Total memory requirements with fusing: 42.92kB = (1152 * (22 + 16) + 176) / 1024
- Improvement: Using 17.83% (with 100% being memory requirements without fusing)
